# What?

> Work performed with an actual purpose (#[[6zy5-deliberate-practice]]), in a state of maximum concentration and reduced distractions, that is also challenging.

# How?

## Before

- Don't wait for inspiration to do SICP. Just start doing SICP.
- Schedule deep work sessions through the day (`org-agenda` or timeblocks), and set goals for them.
- Do stuff that is challenging every time.
- _I think it's extra, but_ choose a strategy:
  a) maximize deep work on weekends (will probably work best for me)
  b) try to fit it in every day

## When doing

- Remove all distractions and possible interruptions (music, wifi, books, random thoughts)
- Schedule sessions for 25+ minutes, to make sure you reach flow.
- Look up unknown things (math, concepts).
