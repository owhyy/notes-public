- Book best used together with code reviews: look at some code, check against red flags shown in book, think about how to replace bad design with good design
- Talks about [[84su-complexity]], modules, information hiding, [[Abstraction]] on different layers, errors, comments, naming
- Good paper: _[[q03h-on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules|On the Criteria to be used in Decomposing Systems into Modules]]_ by David Parnas, talks about problem decomposition. Author argues that taking a complex problem and divinding it into smaller ones is the most fundamental problem in computer science. As a whole, this is true, but it's nothing new.
- [[5xwm-talent-is-overrated|Talent is Overrated]] by Geoff Colvin -- book on innate ability, and how practice is more important
- Goals of current books are:
  - explaining what complexity is
  - how to minimize it
