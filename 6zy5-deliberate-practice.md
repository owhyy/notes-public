- Everything can be learned. You can become just as good as Mozart, Einstein, \<insert genius name here\>. There's no such thing as talent, or IQ. IQ only matters when you start.
- You don't get better at stuff only by doing. In every domain, there's a place where you become _good enough_, and then stop practicing, because it becomes automatic (e.g. when driving, you struggle a bit untill everything becomes automatic, and then you stop practicing and just _drive_). Then it's just naive practice.
- Purposeful practice is the exact opposite of this. With this kind of practice you have:

  1. A well-defined goal: What _exactly_ do I want to accomplish in this practice session? What counts as a good result? (playing a piece correctly n times at a specific speed, being able to implement an algorithm from memory, being able to explain on paper how a program/system works, being able to play 5 moves of a chess opening)
  2. Immediate feedback: Did I succeed or fail (could I play the piece correctly n times, or not; can I implement the program, or not, etc.)
  3. Increasing difficulty. Everything you do should be slightly above your comfort level; you should always be pushing yourself, but doing so little by little.
  4. Has to be focused: avoid distractions, don't listen to music, basically do everything you can to concentrate on practicing.

- Basically, for programming, pick something you want to become good at: _I want to become good at Functional Programming_. Now, think about the steps you'll do for this to happen: _I'll do this courses, read those books, watch those lectures, in this time period. I'll do x hours every day_. Now, for every course, lecture, book, pick specific goals: _I want to be able to explain this concept on paper_, _I want to be able to implement the code example from the lecture from my head_, for every reading session have a specific goal (i.e. know what you are looking for). Also, reading in multiple passes, where you first get comfortable with the material, and then read for specific things. **SET SPECIFIC GOALS FOR EVERY PRACTICE SESSION**
