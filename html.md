# General
- An *element* is some content inside a opening and closing tag: `<head>some contend</head>`. But there are also *empty elements* (where you don't have to `</>`): `<img src=...>`. You can `</>` if you want the HTML page to be valid XML
- Block-level vs inline elements:
  - Block-level means related to structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
  - Inline means text-related (bold, hyperlink, italic)
- Elements can have *attributes* (`src=` in the img example above)
  - Booleans can omit the =... part: `disabled="disabled"` -> `disbled`
- Always use "" in URLs

# HTML Page structure
- `<html>` -- root of the page
- `<head>` -- where you add metadata (title, javascript and css source file location etc)
- `<body>` -- actual content

- *DOM* is the tree of a page (which HTML elements are inside which HTML elements)
- Is DOM same as structure?
