# How to take good anki notes
### 1. Questions and answers should be atomic:
BAD: 
Q: "What command do you use to create a symlink?"
A: "ln -s filename linkname"

GOOD:
Q: "What is the basic command for a link?"
A: "ln -s"
Q: "In what order do the arguments to ln -s come?" 
A: "filename linkname"

## 2. Make sure you learn the stuff first, then do the ankis
That is, do not create ankis on stuff that is not related or not first understood. Anki notes are just for improving memory and recall. Check [[How to learn stuff]] first.
