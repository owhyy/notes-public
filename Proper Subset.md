 + let $S_1=\{1,2,3\}$ and $S_2=\{1,2\}$ 
 $S_2 \subseteq S_1$ ($S_2$ is a subset of $S_1$) means that *every element in $S_2$ must also be a member of $S_1$*
 $S_2 \subset S_1$ ($S_2$ is a *proper* subset of $S_1$) means that $S_2 \subseteq S_1$ and $S_1 \nsubseteq S_2$. In other words,  *every member in $S_2$ is also a member of $S_1$ but not every member of $S_1$ is also a member of $S_2$*
