# Databases
#Databases 
> The main thing in which you create users and tables
+ **database** is the container, the **tables** are the stuff in it. The **schema** is the information about the table.
+ A **column** is a field in a table. It has some **type**. A **row** is a completed table/record/inregistrare.
> Always define **primary keys**, so you can manage the table in the future

+ Databases are modified in a DataBase Management Studio (DBMS), which there are more of, and which mostly differ in their [[Functions|functions]].
+ DBMS are used to manipulate large amounts of data.
+ See also [[Relational databases]].
