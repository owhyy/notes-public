#Databases

> The main thing in which you create users and tables

- **database** is the container, the **tables** are the stuff in it. The **schema** is the information about the table.
- A **column** is a field in a table. It has some **type**. A **row** is a completed table/record/inregistrare.

  > Always define **primary keys**, so you can manage the table in the future

[[Functions]].
- DBMS are used to manipulate large amounts of data.
- See also [[Relational databases]].
