# There are 4 phases to solving a problem:

1. Undestanding the problem.
   - ask the questions "What is the unknown?", "What is the data?", "What is the condition?" "Is it possible to satisfy the condition?"
   - look at the unknown and try to find a problem with a similar unknown; introduce new notation (variables names for lengths, etc)
   - draw a figure, and point out the unknown and the known on it
2. Seeing how the items are connected (how the unknown is linked to data), in order to make a plan.
   - ask: "Do you know a related problem?"
   - if you find any, try to solve them first
   - restate the problem; go around in circles, adding new stuff just to make the problem simmilar to other problems you may have solved in the past
3. Carrying out the plan.
   - understand if you can see that the step is correct VS prove that it is correct
4. Looking back at the completed solution, reviewing and discussing it.
   - check the result; make sure you used all the data;
   - check the arguments; make sure you can prove them
   - ask "Can you derive the result differently?" "Can you see it at a glance?"
   - create some tests; try some other values, and make sure that the results change accodingly
   - finally, ask "Can we use the result or method for some other problem?"
