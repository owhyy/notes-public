# Principles

1. [[Abstraction]]
2. [[Incapsulation]]
3. [[w3fc-modularization]]
4. [[Hierarchization]]
5. [[Inheritance]]
6. [[Polymorphism]]
7. [[im18-overloading]]

## #[[Function Closures]]

> achieved via [[Class|classes]]:

- you can't have an array of arrays, but you can have an array of class objects that contain arrays as their fields
- this means that closure in [[2by8-scheme]] is cooler
- I have wondered if there are languages that offer both, arrays and lists, but I doubt it's needed, as they are generally used for the same kinds of things, and lists are easier to use
