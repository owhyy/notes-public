# File system in DBMS
#Databases 

+ Hard Drive $\rightarrow$ File System $\rightarrow$ File - the File System is used to manipulate data;
+ Hard Drive $\rightarrow$ File System $\rightarrow$ Table - the [[Databases and Tables|DBMS]] is used to manipulate the tables
+ Why use DBMS:
	1.  Data is structured (can have a type, format)
	2.  No need to know the location in order to access the data
	3.  You can access small bits of data (you don't have to download a 20GB file to access only one row of it)
	4.  You avoid redundancy 
	5.  You can easily search data using a query, not having to write a program
	6.  You can manipulate access to specific small bits of the data
	7.  Concurrent access
