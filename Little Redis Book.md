# Data types

- You can perform actions in parallel(pipelining) by batching(read up on how to do it in python)
- You can have atomic operation batches (group a bunch of operations as a entire unit, execute either all of them, or none)
- Don't use the `keys` command in prod, because it's slow. Use a hash
