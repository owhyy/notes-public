# How?

Generic interfaces are implemented via [[7o49-dispatch-on-type]] or [[unl2-data-dircted-programming]]

## Whenever working with generic interfaces, we have this kind of table:

                  | Type 1       | Type 2       |
                  |------------- | ------------ |

Generic operation | T1-Operation | T2-Operation |

> [[7o49-dispatch-on-type]] vs [[unl2-data-dircted-programming]] is similar to [[Functional Programming|Functional Programming vs OOP]]
