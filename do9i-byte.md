- Smallest piece of [[ad6a-memory]]#, represented as a collection of 8 [[9t6c-bits]]#, and indexed by an number, called _address_.

# Data Sizes

The number of bits determines the maximum size of memory addresses (the maximum _virutal address space_) and the maximal numeric value that can be represented for 1 word.

## 32/64-bit systems

- One word is 32/64 bits, or 4/8 bytes
- Biggest number that can be represented is $2^{32}$/$2^{64}$ per byte
- $2^{32}$/$2^{64}$ possible addresses, and therefore bytes/data type
