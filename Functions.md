> A function is something that manipulates some data

It does so by taking some input (Domain) and returning something (Range)
## Aggregate functions
+ general functions, that are applied to all the rows (MAX, MIN, AVERAGE)
+ functions are very problematic as they are very [[Databases and Tables|DBMS]]-specific.

## First class and Higher-order functions
+ first class functions - functions that can be used as simple data
+ [[Higher-order procedures|higher-order functions]]- functions that can take and return functions

# Pure functions
