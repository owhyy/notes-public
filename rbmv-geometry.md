# A point is something we can't split up anymore.
  However, there is a dilemma. If we zoom into a point, the point becomes something else (a black circle). So, we can't be sure that a point we see is actually a point: the stars are seen as points, even when zoomed, but they are actually huge objects, or a house, seen from a plane, is just a point, but in reality - it's a house!

# A line
  Has the same dilemma as a point: if we zoom in a lot into the line, it becomes something new. But also, a line has no beginning and no end.

# Parallel lines are lines that will never intersect
