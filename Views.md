> A view is a [[Databases and Tables|table]] used only for [[Clauses|retrieving data]]/results of [[Queries]].

**Views** can also be thought of as some kind of [[Stored procedures|stored procedure]], in the sense that you can reuse the `SELECT` statement, but is also different, as a view is a sort of table on its own, so you can perform [[Queries|queries]] on it too.

> You can't have `ORDER BY` clauses in a view
