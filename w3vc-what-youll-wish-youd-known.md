# Find out what you like, and work hard on that

- This is is really difficult, and can take as much as your entire life sadly. Most famous example is Newton, who, before becoming a mathematician and physicist spent a lot of time in alchemy and theology. Imagine if he didn't try mathematics, and only studied theology?
- It's important to always try new things. I've seen a lot of people saying this -- try learning something new that piques your interest every month. However, there's also the risk of becoming _jack of all master of none_ if you do this too much. With some things, like programming, you need to put in a lot of effort to realize what it's really about, so you need to be ready to be obsessed with everything you try. You most likely won't be, but every new thing you try has to be deeply interesting to you.

# Don't be bound by your dreams or plans you made early on

- Again, the Newton example. Had he been bound by "Oh, I put too much effort into theology to let it go and try something new", we wouldn't have known of him. To be the best at something, you need to be obsessed by it. If you're not, you should just let go and try something new.

# Hard work is much more important than being a genius

- Genius is just an excuse for being lazy. "Oh, x is a genius, so it doesn't matter how much I work. I'm not a genius so I'll never be ale to reach his level". I think genius is just a deep passion about something. Being able to work yourself out doing something for tens of years and not lose interest -- that's what being a genius is.

# When not knowing what you like, work on that which will open up most possibilities

- Becoming really good in a well-known topic will open more possibilities than doing the same, but in a niche topic. Untill you know what you like, do things that will allow you to choose from the most things.

# Always be working on hard problems

- Constantly push yourself by doing stuff that's harder than your level, that you have to learn. Pick stuff that has a lot of prerequisites, so that it becomes a project, and you fill all the gaps and actually apply the knowledge. [[6zy5-deliberate-practice]]

# Take responsability for yourself, your actions and thoughts

- You're the one in charge for yourself, your past, present and future. An adult takes responsability for what he does and for who he is. You're the one responsible for becoming great. you're the only one who can help yourself.

# Schedule is less imporant than you think

- Most great people are procrastinators (interesting idea). Strive to make doing what you love your way of procrastination.

# Don't waste time

- Do only what matters, and only that which matters right now. Don't read bad books, don't listen to bad music, don't watch bad movies.

# Be curious about everything in your domain

- Be deep and shallow. Ask lots of questions and find the answers to them for the area you love. Question latest trends, question how stuff is built and how it works. Break apart and rebuild stuf (I'll do this with open-source projects).
