# How to learn stuff
## For textbook stuff:
1. Priming the information. This means flipping through the pages, looking at the images and headlines, and actively asking questions such as "how is this thing related to that other thing?", "why does the author talk about this first, and then this?" "what is the relationship between them", and making assumptions, trying to answer them in order to get an general idea of the way the information is structured and how it is related. *This is a mental step*
2. After priming is done, or you feel your head ready to explode, try to put on paper the structure inside your head. Most likely it will be a very simple diagram or sketch. This is good, because you've got a skeleton on which to build. Now is when you answer your questions and actually verifying your assumptions, so you're not you're not reading without purpose. You're like a detective: you search for the specific information you need at that time, ignoring anything else, and you add it to your mind and your diagram.
3. Now you should have a bigger diagram. However, we only read the things we needed. Now, read everything else, top to bottom, in order to make sure we haven't forgotten anything that we didn't think about (which happens quite often).

## Also:
1. Active recall. After reading or learning something new, close the material and try to rememeber it without help. If you can't, go back and re-read the things you coulnd't remember.
2. Feynman technique. Explain what you're trying to learn to a 5 year old. Do it over and over again, simplifying it every time. If there are some parts you're having trouble with, re-read them and understand them.
3. Spaced repetition. Re-read your notes, and create ankis.
