# How to solve it

#Math

**Most important: keep working. Don't just abandon the problem and go looking for the solution if you can't instantly think of a solution.**

1. **Understand the problem.** Don't rush to solving a problem you have a uncomplete understanding of it:

   - what is the unknown?
   - what data are we given?
   - did we use all conditions?
   - how can we connect the known to the unknown?
   - _stuck?_
     - find things that are similar, or easier
     - can't do the above? find easier things and do them first; split the problem up into bits, solve the easiest and progress to the hardest

2. **Solving the problem:**

   - as you keep working through the problem, ask yourself: "why did I do this?" "why does this make sense, or why doesn't it?"
   - try proving, or at least seeing that it makes sense

3. **After solving the problem:**
   - think about how you proved it, how you could have proved it differently, and how might you use it on other problems
